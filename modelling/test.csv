Changing the assessment/rubric in this case involves more than just an individual instructor.","Goals created by others (the individual student or instructor or a particular program) can be mapped to larger campus/school goals.

Some rubrics may be general purpose rubrics that are NOT tied to an assessment, but the dissemination of these approved rubrics may be a
strategy of an institution to push forward an agenda of best practice for assessment by providing a handy reference library of general purpose writing, mathematics and science rubrics (for example). While the choice whether or not to use one of these ""off the shelf"" rubrics (and which one) is left to the teacher, providing some information to the teacher about the schools expectations of its students at different stages (and perhaps suggesting an appropriate rubric for this grade level/stage of development) would make this service more valuable.","Some items in the library of ""off the shelf"" goals and rubrics are merely starting points. There is not a priority to ensure that everyone is doing assessment the exact same way. When a teacher uses one of these rubrics, they can easily edit the performance indicators to suit their needs and create a new rubric, just for their new assignment.

Goals and rubrics can be shared with others. This is a bottom up approach to establishing ""best practice"". As the
teachers create their own rubrics against goals, they have the opportunity to publish them as part of the ""reusable"" library so other teachers can use/edit/republish them.",,"Asessment, Feedback, Tracking

I could then go in and either approve the content to be viewable by others, be able to edit the content or delete it.
