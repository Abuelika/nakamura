=head1 Authorization

=head2 Building on Jackrabbit

Authorization in the next generation sakai will, as far as is possible, use the
default authorization capabilities exposed by Sling though some customization
may be required and maintained. Authorization in Sling is in turn built on top
of functionality exposed by jackrabbit. Jackrabbit 1.5 is transitioning to the
JSR-283 AccessControlManager API implemented by the DefaultAccessManager
providing Access Control Lists that contain Access Control Entries. Each Entry
is associated with a Principal by name, that principal identifying an
Authorizable user or group via the PrincipalManager implementation.
